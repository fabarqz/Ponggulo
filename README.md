This is a pong clone made using the Phaser 3 framework. Additionally, parcel bundler is used for building and hosting the local server for this project.

The name of this project is a portmanteau of the words Pong, the game, and gulo, a Filipino word roughly meaning mess or disorder. It is also a play on the word panggulo which can translate to something/someone that can cause disorder or is a nuisance.

The tutorial Phaser 3 Game Tutorial - 01 - 03 by jest array from youtube was used as reference for setting up this project.
For the rest of the pong game I followed the tutorial How to Really Make a Phaser Game from Scratch! Parts 1 - 4 by ourcade channel.

The up and down buttons are used for controlling the player paddle.

To score a goal you only need to make sure the 'white' ball gets past the computer paddle's boundary. 

The rest of the balls do not affect the score and are simply there to influence the scoring balls movement for added variety, hence the name of this project Ponggulo.
